    'long_description': "# Scaffolding for Brewblox service applications\n\nIn order to reduce code duplication between services, generic functionality is implemented here.\n\nFor an example on how to implement your own service based on `brewblox-service`, see <https://github.com/brewblox/brewblox-boilerplate>.\n\n`brewblox-service` can technically be launched as a standalone application, but will not be very useful.\n\n## [brewblox_service](./brewblox_service/__init__.py)\n\nSmall generic tools are defined here.\n\n`brewblox_logger` can be used for creating module-specific loggers. It is not required, but will play a bit nicer with default formatting of the log.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nfrom brewblox_service import brewblox_logger\n\nLOGGER = brewblox_logger(__name__)\nLOGGER.info('hello')\n```\n\n## [service.py](./brewblox_service/service.py)\n\nParses commandline arguments, creates an `aiohttp` app, and runs it.\n\nThe shortest implementation is:\n\n```python\napp = service.create_app(default_name='my_service')\nservice.furnish(app)\nservice.run(app)\n```\n\nThis will get you a working web application, but it will only support the `/_service/status` health check endpoint.\n\nApplications can configure their own features, and add new commandline arguments.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\n# Separately creating the parser allows adding arguments to the default set\nparser = service.create_parser(default_name='my_service')\nparser.add_argument('--my-arg')\n\n# Now create the app\napp = service.create_app(parser=create_parser())\n\n# Add features for this service\ndevice.setup(app)\napi.setup(app)\n\n# Furnish and run\nservice.furnish(app)\nservice.run(app)\n```\n\n## [features.py](./brewblox_service/features.py)\n\nMany service features are application-scoped. Their lifecycle should span multiple requests, either because they are not request-driven, or because they manage asynchronous I/O operations (such as listening to AMQP messages).\n\nThe `ServiceFeature` class offers an abstract base class for this behavior. Implementing classes should define `startup(app)` and `shutdown(app)` functions, and those will be automatically called when the application starts up and shuts down.\n\nBoth `startup()` and `shutdown()` are called in an async context, making them the async counterparts of `__init__()` and `__del__()` functions.\n\nFeatures must be constructed after the app is created, but before it starts running. (`service.create_app()` and `service.run(app)`)\n\nThe `add()` and `get()` functions make it easy to centrally declare a feature, and then use it in any function that has a reference to the aiohttp app.\n\n## [events.py](./brewblox_service/events.py)\n\nBoth incoming and outgoing communication with the AMQP eventbus is handled here.\n\n`EventListener` allows subscribing to eventbus messages. It will fire a callback when one is received. Subscriptions can be set at any time (also before the app starts running).\n\nThe listener is designed to gracefully degrade when the eventbus can't be reached. No errors will be raised, and it will periodically attempt to reconnect and restore its subscriptions.\n\nFor a practical implementation of `EventListener`, see [brewblox_history](https://github.com/BrewBlox/brewblox-history/blob/develop/brewblox_history/influx.py)\n\n`EventPublisher` is responsible for sending new messages to the eventbus. A single publisher per application is sufficient.\n\nIn contrast with `EventListener`, the publisher will raise an exception when attempting to publish to an unreachable eventbus host.\nIt will attempt to reconnect for each subsequent message - no explicit connection management is required.\n",
